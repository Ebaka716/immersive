## Product Context
This file explains why this project exists, the problems it solves, how it should work, and user experience goals.

## Purpose
To create an interactive, testable "chat + search" UI prototype that stakeholders can click through and validate before full development.

## Problem Solved
Provides a tangible front-end experience for early feedback, reducing risk and aligning expectations.

## How it Should Work
- Inspired by Perplexity's UX.
- Full-page layout with Header, persistent Sidebar, and content area.
- Bottom-pinned chat/search input.
- Configurable panes.

## User Experience Goals
- Flexible and modular interface.
- Clear separation of components (Header, Sidebar, Content, Input).
- Smooth interaction for core chat/search flow.
